# Library Management System

## Overview
This Java-based Library Management System allows users to manage a library's books and users. It includes features for adding and deleting books, registering and logging in users, issuing and renewing books, and printing user and book databases.

## Classes

### 1. **Book**
   - Represents a book with attributes like id, title, and author.

### 2. **User**
   - Represents a user with attributes like id and name.

### 3. **TreeNode<T>**
   - Generic class representing a binary tree node with data, left, and right pointers.

### 4. **LibraryManagementSystem**
   - Main class managing the library system.
   - Includes methods for registering users, logging in, adding and deleting books, issuing and renewing books, and printing user and book databases.

### 5. **Main**
   - Main class containing the `main` method to run the Library Management System.
   - Provides a console-based interface for admins and users.

### 6. **Trees**
   - Empty class, possibly intended for future use or expansion.

### 7. **Node<type>**
   - Generic class representing a node in a binary tree with data, left, and right pointers.
   - Used in the `LibManSystem` class.

### 8. **Books**
   - Represents a book with attributes like bookid, bookname, and authorName.
   - Used in the `LibManSystem` class.

### 9. **Users**
   - Represents a user with attributes like userid and username.
   - Used in the `LibManSystem` class.

### 10. **LibManSystem**
   - Another class for managing the library system, seemingly an alternative or earlier version.
   - Includes methods for registering users, logging in, and inserting nodes into binary trees.

## How to Use

1. Run the `Main` class.
2. Choose between Admin and User modes.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform actions such as adding/deleting books, registering/logging in users, and issuing/renewing books.
4. Exit the program when done.

## Important Notes

- Ensure valid input: The system may prompt for specific data types, and incorrect inputs may lead to errors.
- Avoid entering existing data during the program run to prevent conflicts.

## Future Development

- The `Trees` class and `LibManSystem` class seem to be incomplete or alternatives. Consider their role in future updates.
